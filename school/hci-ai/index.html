                <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>In today's world, terms including <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> get thrown around a lot. But what do they actually mean?</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    <strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> (AI) refers to the ability for machine to accomplish complex goals. The main premise here is that the computer is able to continually learn from data it collects. This is divided into two subdefinitions:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Weak AI</strong> &ndash; An AI system designed to accomplish a specific task. Examples include voice recognition (Siri) and AlphaGo (designed to play only Go).</li>
                        <li><strong>Strong AI</strong> &ndash; An AI system capable to learn. When presented with a new problem, it can use prior intelligence to design a solution. Examples include human-level intelligence.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    <strong>Machine Learning</strong> is an application of AI, where computers are given large amounts of data and draw their own connections. For example, if computers are given your entire shopping or browsing history, they can learn to make pretty reliable guesses as to what you may want to purchase or view next. (Other examples include email spam filters, self-driving cars, and face-recognition software.)
                    <br><br>
                    Machine learning is very popular today; companies are collecting massive amounts of data which can be used to "train" these AIs, developing reliable machine learning algorithms.
                </div>

                <p>Many of our current definitions for AI are based on what humans can do. This alone poses some fairly philosophical and existential questions, including what makes us human, but before we dive into those, let's first take a look at the history of AI.</p>

                        <p>At this point, you might be thinking: how does this relate to AI? For much of our history, nearly all manufacturing was done in private residences without machinery. However, with the Industrial Revolution, all that changed. Large factories were built, with machines being used for much of the mass-production process. Our society quickly became dependent on these machines, in terms of economy, employment, and production.</p>

                    <li><strong>~1950 &ndash; <small>current</small></strong> &mdash; <span class="li-title">Information Age</span>
                        <p>The Information Age refers to the digitization of information and the widespread use of the world-wide web. Similar to the Industrial Revolution, this brought myriads of new jobs, forms of entertainment, and opportunities for commerce.</p>

                        <p>The concept of sentient machines has been around for thousands of years, appearing in ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese culture, art, and folklore. However, research in this field wasn't officially started until 1956, when the term was coined.</p>
                        <p>There were several subsequent decades of research stagnation, and it wasn't until the 1990's with the rise of personal computers when people were able to realize the true potential of AI and research started again.</p>

                <h2>AI as Depicted in Film</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is frequently depicted in numerous forms in various science-fiction films. What are those forms, and what does that say about our cultural understanding of AI?</p>
                <!-- Explore various films: Blade Runner, Interstellar, 2001, Ex Machina, Her? -->

                <img class="image image-right" src="img/bladerunner-title.jpg">
                <h3>Blade Runner</h3>

                <p>In <em>Blade Runner</em>, Ridley Scott does two very interesting things with his portrayal of artificial intelligence.</p>

                <p>AI robots, called "replicants", are <strong>initially portrayed as inherently violent, destructive, and greedy</strong>. The replicants are humanlike in appearance and have been given four-year lifespans. After being banished from Earth, they soon figure out that their death is inevitable, and come back to remedy the situation:</p>

                <span class="quote-box-small">"I want life, fucker."</span>

                <p>The duty of blade runners (including Deckard) is to track down and kill these replicants. From the opening info slide that gives context on this plot, these <strong>replicants are objectively dehumanized and treated like monsters</strong>:</p>
                <span class="quote-box-small">"This was not called execution. It was called retirement."</span>

                <p>However, <strong>as the film progresses, Deckard becomes progressively dehumanized while the replicants become more and more human</strong>. Replicants are identified through an "emotion test", which is supposed to evoke emotions that only humans can have. The concept that the determination of one's identity is subjective poses a problematic scenario, and as the plot evolves, becomes central to the conflict.</p>

                <img class="image image-left image-large" src="img/bladerunner-tearsinrain.jpg">
                <p>At the end of the film, replicant Roy Batty, who Deckard has been trying to kill for much of the film, saves Deckard from his imminent death. Batty proceeds to deliver his "Tears in Rain" monologue before he dies:</p>

                <p class="quote-box-small">"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.<br>
                    Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.<br>
                    I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh&auml;user Gate.<br>
                    All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."</p>

                <p>Batty's speech, arguably one of the greatest in film history, is a true expression of his own unique humanity and identity, and leaves the audience feeling sympathetic for him and questioning the true meaning of human identity. The motto of the Tyrell Corporation (the makers of the replicant robots) certainly rings true:</p>
                <span class="quote-box-small">"More human than human."</span>

                <p>These two juxtaposed qualities of AI being both violent and capable of humanlike emotion leaves the audience with more questions than answers. <strong>What makes humans human? What is the different between man and replicant?</strong> This hypothetical society depicted in Blade Runner serves to demonstrate the consequences of a world where technological possibilities are endless, yet the citizenry is apathetic and impassive toward these technological advances.</p>

                <h3>Ex Machina</h3>
                <img class="image image-left" src="img/exmachina-title.jpg">
                <p>???</p>

                <div class="separator"></div>

                <img class="image image-right" src="img/interstellar-title.jpg">
                <h3>Interstellar</h3>
                <p><em>Interstellar's</em> portrayal of sentient machines is quite different than many sci-fi films. TARS, the robot that accompanies the crew as they go on an intergalactic mission <strong>looks like no other film depiction of AI</strong>. Additionally, <strong>TARS' interests align with human intersts</strong>, and it saves lives and makes valuable contributions to the crew's mission.</p>

                <p><strong>Despite looking nothing like a human, TARS still maintains several human qualities.</strong> For starters, it speaks English, can communicate with humans, and even has "honesty" and "humor" settings.</p>

                <p class="quote-box-small">Cooper: "Humor, seventy-five percent."<br>
                    TARS: "Confirmed. Self destruct sequence in T minus 10, 9..."</p>

                <p><strong>TARS' transparency and customizability</strong> starkly contrasts other AI portayals in films, and shifts the conflict away from human vs. AI. Interestingly, despite its human qualities, TARS does not seemed to have developed full  self-awareness or have any biological survival instincts because TARS only acts in human interest and is incredibly selfless.</p>

                <p class="quote-box-small">Brand: "Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us."<br>
                    Cooper: "He's a robot. So you don't have to *ask* him to do anything."<br>
                    Brand: "Cooper, you asshole!"<br>
                    Cooper: "Sorry, you broke up a little bit there."<br>
                    TARS: "It's what we intended, Dr. Brand. It's our only chance to save the people on Earth..."</p>

                <img class="image image-left image-large" src="img/interstellar-tars.jpg">

                <p>Throughout the film, TARS plays a pivotal role in the crew's success, and saves many lives. This portrayal of AI as helpful, selfless, and almost slaves for humans is what many people hope for the future of AI to look like. TARS never turns evil, never tries to kill anybody, and helps the crew as they save humanity.</p>

                <p><em>Interstellar</em> shows the endless possibilities of a world where AI and human goals are in-line and there is mutual understanding between the two entities.</p>
