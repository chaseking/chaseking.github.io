                        <p>Join us as we hike from central Marin to the Pacific Ocean! We'll start our morning at Phoenix Lake and wander our way around reservoirs, cool redwood forests and over Mt. Tamalpais. Along the way we'll chat, sing, and take in the incredible natural beauty Marin has to offer. We'll eventually pop out of the woods onto a rolling grassy ridge that drops to the ocean. After enjoying the breathtaking views of the coast we'll descend to the sea where milkshakes and burgers await us at The Parkside snack shack in the early-afternoon. We will also hang out on the beach for a bit!</p>

                        <p>At the end of the day, we'll hop in our chariot (read: MA van), which will be parked at Stinson already. We should be back by 5PM at the latest, earlier if we feel like it. You need to be in reasonable shape for this, but you don't need any hiking experience. There are both steep uphill and downhill sections of this trail so if you have weak knees or ankles, consider your footwear carefully. You will need sturdy hiking shoes and a daypack with layers, a raincoat, a sizeable snack or three, a water bottle, and some cash if you'd like a burger or shake. Join us on our perfect Marin day-adventure.</p>

            <h2>Policies and Procedures</h2>

            <h3>Sign-Ups and Permission Forms</h3>
            <p>MA outings are open to everyone and each outing has a maximum number of students it can safely accommodate. Our sign up system is designed to be smooth, to increase communication with families, and to maximize trip participation. The process is outlined below:</p>

            <p>Outings sign ups have three steps. You are not signed up for an outing until all three stages are complete.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Sign Up Online</strong> Students receive an email with a link to an online sign up form on the day that sign ups open. Students should  fill out a separate form for each outing they hope to participate in.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Receive "Trip Status" Email</strong> Students will receive an email from Julie letting them know if they are ON an outing, or on the WAITLIST for an outing.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Step 3: Turn In Permission Form To Con rm Spot On Outing or Waitlist</strong> Once they have received email con rmation of their outing's status, students must turn in permission forms to Julie Barnes' of ce to con rm their spot both on an outing and on an outing's waitlist. If students do NOT wish to be on a trip or
wait list, they must email outings@ma.org.</p>

            <h3>Permission Forms</h3>
            <p>Permission forms will be attached to the “trip status” email that students will receive. Permission forms are also available on the MA Outings of ce door, on-line through the outings page, and on the Outings Group My MA page.</p>

            <p>Turning in a permission form signifies that students and families have CHECKED THEIR CALENDARS and have con rmed that the student will be participating in the outing. <strong>It also signifies that all parties understand that a trip cancellation fee will be applied to the family if the student cancels within two weeks of the outing.</strong> (See below for details on trip cancellation)</p>
